Program purpose: calculates a sound wave time in fps through a particular medium.

Input
- Ask use to select a substance from the medium menu:
1. Air, 2.Water, 3.Steel, 4. Quit program
- Ask user to enter the number of feet the sound wave will travel.

Process
- Set named constants to hold speed of sound in fps in each medium:
AIR = 1100, WATER = 4900, STEEL = 16400

- Set variable choice = the medium user selects.

- Set variable travelDistance = the number of feet user enters.

- Define variable travelTime

- Validate valid menu choice and calculate the travel time of the sound wave in seconds:
. If choice = 1,
Calculate travelTime = travelDistance / speed_Air.
. If choice = 2,
Calculate travelTime = travelDistance / speed_Water.
. If choice = 3,
Calculate travelTime = travelDistance / speed_Steel.
. If choice  = 4 ,
Terminate the program
. If choice != 4,
Display the message

Output
- A brief of program description.
- Display the number of feet and the number of seconds based on the user input.
